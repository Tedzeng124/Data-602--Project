The column names of the feature(s):

    Make (Car manufacturer)
    Model (Car model)
    Model Year (Model year)
    Electric Vehicle Type (Electric vehicle type)
    Electric Range (Electric range)
    Base MSRP (Manufacturer suggested retail price)
    County (County)

The target outcome:

    Predict the price of different electric vehicles (Base MSRP)
    Analyze the market distribution of different electric vehicle types, by county or by manufacturer
    Study the relationship between electric range and price, or the trend of electric vehicle year and range

Initial plan:

    Handling Date Features: Convert the Model Year column to the age of the vehicle (current year minus vehicle year) as a new feature Vehicle Age.
    Handling Electric Vehicle Type: Convert the Electric Vehicle Type column to numeric or categorical data.
    Handling Regional Features: You can convert County to categorical data. You can perform geographical grouping and analyze the distribution of vehicles by region.
    Electric Range Ratio: You can calculate a range ratio based on Electric Range and Model Year (Electric Range/Model Year) to study the progress of electric vehicle range over time.
