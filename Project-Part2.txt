The column names of the feature(s):

    Make (Car manufacturer)
    Model (Car model)
    Model Year (Model year)
    Electric Vehicle Type (Electric vehicle type)
    Electric Range (Electric range)
    Base MSRP (Manufacturer suggested retail price)
    County (County)

The target outcome:

    Predict the price of different electric vehicles (Base MSRP)
    Analyze the market distribution of different electric vehicle types, by county or by manufacturer
    Study the relationship between electric range and price, or the trend of electric vehicle year and range

Initial plan:

    Handling Date Features: Convert the Model Year column to the age of the vehicle (current year minus vehicle year) as a new feature Vehicle Age.
    Handling Electric Vehicle Type: Convert the Electric Vehicle Type column to numeric or categorical data.
    Handling Regional Features: You can convert County to categorical data. You can perform geographical grouping and analyze the distribution of vehicles by region.
    Electric Range Ratio: You can calculate a range ratio based on Electric Range and Model Year (Electric Range/Model Year) to study the progress of electric vehicle range over time.


Approach to dealing with imbalanced data:

We will closely monitor the dataset for any potential imbalances, especially in key categorical features like Make and Electric Vehicle Type. If we detect an imbalance that exceeds a 7:3 ratio, we will implement the following strategies:

	1.	Oversampling: If certain vehicle types or manufacturers are underrepresented, we will use techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to create synthetic samples, ensuring the model doesnâ€™t overfit to the majority class  .
	2.	Class Weighting: In models like XGBoost, we will apply class weighting, adjusting the loss function to give higher importance to the minority class, which helps improve model performance across all categories .
	3.      Undersampling: If one or few majority classes has significantly more data than other classes. We want to use the underspampling method
to reduce the number of observations of majority classes.

If the class distributions show reasonable balance (e.g., below a 5:1 ratio), we may choose not to apply these techniques, keeping the modeling process simple and efficient.

For example: We find out that the car manufacturer "TESLA" contributes 88083 out of 200048 data, which is significantly more than other 41 manufacurer.
Therefore, we want to balance these data. If we choose Oversmapling method, a situation that is likely happen is that we need to oversampling for all
41 manufacurer except "TESLA". Therefore, a undersampling method to reduce only the data of "TESLA" is more practicable.
